Louis Germain David de Funès de Galarza (31 July 1914 – 27 January 1983) was a French actor and comedian. According to several polls conducted since 1968, he is France's favourite actor – having played over 130 roles in film and over 100 on stage.[2] His acting style is remembered for its high-energy performance and his wide range of facial expressions and tics. A considerable part of his best-known acting was directed by Jean Girault.

de Funès is one of the most famous French actors of all time, and even more so when it comes to his international celebrity.

Besides his extreme fame in the French-speaking world he also still is a household name in places like Italy, Germany, Spain, Turkey, Iran, Greece, Israel, Albania, the former Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union as well as other former Warsaw Pact countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.

Despite this he remains almost unknown in the English-speaking world. He was exposed to a wider audience only once in the United States, in 1974, with the release of The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob, which was nominated for a Golden Globe Award.
